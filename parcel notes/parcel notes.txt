Note: sometimes import $ from 'jquery' will not work, you will have to do npm install jquery  (i.e without global -g flag)
https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel ,see example there:

run
parcel index.html
and open the given link to see module importing/working

use --https flag to test things which only works on https , such as Add to home screen option
parcel index.html --https

to build for production:
parcel build index.html
files will be in dist, serve those files through http serve to see the magic

or in a specific folder
parcel build index.html -d foldername


For askgod https://github.com/fawazahmed0/askgod project, I have set /docs folder for pushing the site.
https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site

I did the build using: parcel build index.html -d docs --public-url ./
public url flag is important when you have project under fawazahmed0.github.io/projectname url, 
you can see the effect of public-url flag by opening index.html in editor and checking the links location

In case of any error, open console to see for any issues


refer https://parceljs.org/cli.html for more details

(Important note)
module features are imported into the scope of a single script â€” they aren't available in the global scope. Therefore, you will only be able to access imported features in the script they are imported into, and you won't be able to access them from the JavaScript console


Also see example for script type="module"
