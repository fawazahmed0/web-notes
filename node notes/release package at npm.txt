npm init

give all the details & also give unique package name not existing in npm registry

In the main code, export it using:
module.exports.functionName = functionName;


(I also added the dependecies, though not required, similar to https://github.com/fawazahmed0/quran-videos/blob/65d13645073b5af415efc7dea2e75fcba6b1262d/package.json#L6)

run the below command from the root of project


npm link

npm link your-package-name



Puslihing:

if doing first time, then:
npm adduser


npm publish


Now you can install it:
npm install your-package-name



To update the package:
update the version in package.json by:
npm version patch         (or you can use minor or major)  (ref: https://docs.npmjs.com/updating-your-published-package-version-number)

npm publish
